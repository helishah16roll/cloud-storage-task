# Multi-Cloud Architecture Demo

This project demonstrates a basic multi-cloud architecture where services are distributed across two cloud platforms:

## 🌐 Cloud Services Used
- *Amazon Web Services (AWS)*: S3 is used to host a static website.
- *Google Drive*: Used to host and share a text file externally.

## 🔗 Live Demo
Visit the website hosted on AWS S3:  
👉 [http://my-multicloud-demo-bucket.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com](http://my-multicloud-demo-bucket.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com)

## 📁 Files
- index.html: Main HTML file hosted on AWS S3  
- Poster Template.txt: File hosted on Google Drive and linked from the website

## 🧩 Interoperability
The AWS S3-hosted webpage includes a link to a Google Drive-hosted file, showcasing interoperability between two different cloud providers.

## 📦 How to Run (for Reviewers)
1. Click on the Live Demo link above.
2. The website will load from AWS S3.
3. You can view:
   - A file hosted on AWS S3
